# Wessons

COVID-19 has affected the economy and health systems around the world but it has also compromised education. Most of the schools or universities weren’t prepared to continue teaching through remote education. There are institutions that haven’t found yet a platform that allows all teachers and students to keep teaching and learning. 
Because teachers can’t just expect that students learn everything on their own with the material they provide. If there is no communication or meetings between them, teachers can’t really know if their students are actually learning something or they just trying to pass this difficult year.
We also know that not all people have access to a computer, but they most probably have a smartphone.

So, we came up with the idea of Wessons, a web application that solves these problems and more. Wessons works with Watson (an AI provided by IBM). Watson is used as a virtual assistant to answer questions or doubts about:
 
-	Information about the school, college or university. Like contact info or the address or attention hours.  As well as information about the authorities.
-	It can give you your course schedule.
-	It can help you with general information about COVID-19.

We are planning to include bracelets with temperature sensors that work with IoT, so schools can know if their students or teachers have COVID-19 symptoms. This knowledge could help schools avoid having outbreaks.  This would help also the government to have a more updated statistics about the cases. 

Wessons allows three kind of users:

-	Administrator: this user would be used by the institution. They need to fill the database with their students, teachers and courses. They also have the possibility of checking how teachers and students are doing.

-	Teachers: after they login, they are going to be directed to a home page that has a calendar so they can have a better view of their pending work or to add new tasks for their students. Wessons also offers them another window with all the courses they have and the subjects they teach. On each subject they have the option to add homework, to announce that the students are going to have a test and also evaluate them on the platform. There is also an option that allows teachers to upload studying material. And the last option allows teachers to announce messages to their students about the subject or about the next virtual meetings. 

-	Students: after they login they also have a home page with a calendar. So, they can see in a more effective way what is their pending homework, tests or virtual meetings. Another window is for the students to see all their subjects and on each subject see in a more detailed way the homework o tests they have to do. They also have access to the studying material the teacher provided them, as well as the announcements or next meetings.

Since we are students that are working with a teacher, we understand all the difficulties teachers and our classmates are going thought so we are also going to include a chat between students and teachers and between just students.  Because we think communication is very important and it has also been affected by COVID-19.

We know Watson can be helpful in many ways, so we are investigating it uses to make more features available and get the best out of it.
We are from Argentina and we know most schools of the country lack of resources to continue their education. Making a web application is making the platform available for any device. Although we are thinking about developing the app for android and iOS.
